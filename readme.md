The colour palette was created by [Coolors](https://coolors.co) with five colors from black to white, the main idea is to make simple pallete without toxic colors, background was created with linear-gradient, which starts with white in the top and ends with black in the bottom, where you can find black footer with white social links, which makes it easier to see.

### Typography
"Open Sans" "Arial" "Sans-serif" and "Monospace" was picked, these fonts looks good and simple and supported by most browsers

### Imagery
All the images on the website, that I used was found on the Pinterest

## Features

#### Login Pop Up

If you dont have an account and press the button it activates transition and signup container appears instead of login container
